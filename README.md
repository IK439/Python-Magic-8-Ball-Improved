# Python-Magic-8-Ball-Improved

## Description

This is a beginner-friendly Python program that simulates a Magic 8-Ball.
It randomly selects an answer from a predefined list in response to a question.

**Note:** This project is an improvement on a standard beginner exercise by making the code cleaner, adding a function, and customizing the answer list.

This version uses:

* Functions
* Lists
* Random selection
* Conditional statements

---

## How it works

1. The program defines a function `get_answer()` that:

   * Contains a list of possible answers
   * Randomly selects one answer using a random index
2. The program has hard-coded values for:

   * `name` (optional, identifies the person asking the question)
   * `question` (the question being asked)
3. It prints the question (and name if provided), then prints the Magic 8-Ball's answer.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save your code as `magic_8_ball.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
4. Run the program with:

```bash
python magic_8_ball.py
```

## Example output

```

Magic 8-Ball's answer: Absolutely working!
```

## Notes

* The answers are hard-coded, but you can modify the list to add your own.
* This project is designed for beginners to practice Python basics such as functions, lists, random numbers, and conditionals.
